#One Time Pad Utilities

Glen Wiley <glen.wiley@gmail.com>

This is a set of command line utilities for creating and using one time pads
for encrypting and decrypting messages on common operating systems.

This tool set will seem awkward and inconvenient when you first begin using it,
however it is useful to note that strong encryption is by its nature awkward and
this is pretty much as strong as it gets (when used properly).
If you prefer convenience and can settle for breakable encrytpion then you are
probably better off with a different tool set.

If you find yourself wondering whether it is worth the trouble, I recommend
that you brush up on cryptography theory and compare one time pad encryption
with other approaches.

#Building and Installing

There are no external dependencies (beyond a modern C compiler).  The interface is 
entirely terminal/CLI based.

#Building

Issue make using the Makefile that matches your operating system, forexample you might invoke make on OSX as:

```
# make -f Makefile.osx
# make -f Makefile.osx install
```

#Recommended Use Cases

##Generate a single sheet

Nearly the simplest way to use the program is:
```
otpadgen -s abb -o text > sheet.otpad
```

##Generate a set of sheets

These sheets can be generated then handed to the peer, in order to use them you
must agree on which sheet in the set you are using.

```
dt=$(date)
for((sn=0;sn<10;sn++))
do
        otpadgen -h"sheet $sn : $dt" -s abb -o text > sheet$sn.otpad
done

```

#How to use one time pads

One of the nifty advantages of one time pads is that they can be generated by 
machine (or even by hand for that matter) and then used to encrypt and decrypt
without assistance from a machine.  It is certainyl faster if you use a computer
to encrypt and decrypt, but it is not difficult to do by hand.

##Host Security
The two most important rules of using one time pads to avoid weakening their utility
as a cryptographic tool are:

* NEVER reuse a one time pad.  There are some cases in which multiple receivers might
use the same pad but NEVER encrypt more than one message with the same bytes in the
same one time pad.
* NEVER share the one time pad with anyone you do not intend to share the clear text
of your message.

It is worth noting that network connected hosts are simply NOT as secure as a machine
that has no interface with the outside world.  The most secure hosts are completely
unreachable (which significantly reduces their utility to legitimate operators).
The hosts used to generate the one time pads should be completely isolated from 
networks and physical access by unauthorized personnel.  Yes this is a pain, but if
you really want strong crypto then this is simply what you have to do.  No matter how
strenuously someone might object and say that they are able to secure their host, if
there is a network connection of any kind then that host can be compromised.

## Choosing a Character set

The character set used to generate the pad is typically just alpha/numeric characters.
In our options we include the space as an underscore character.  A full alphabet 
includes a number of the more useful symbols, the downside to these is that when
they are handwritten it is not difficult to make a mistake interpreting what
someone else has written.

Choosing how you will write characters (if you and encrypting by hand) is also
very important - it is a good idea to make you fours (4) and nines (9) distinct,
your sevens (7) and ones (1), zeros (0) and ohs (O).

##How to Encrypt
1. Coordinate which sheet you will be using with the receiving party.
2. Write your clear text above the characters on the sheet.
3. For each character:
- Look up the clear text character on the column header in the matrix.
- Look up the key character on the row header in the matrix.
- The enrypted character is at the interesction of the column/row write that below the key character on your sheet.
- The characters under the key text are your encrypted message, send this to the receiving party.
4. Rejoice at the strength of your cryptography!

##How to Decrypt
1. Coordinate which sheet you will use with the sender.
2. Write the encrypted message BELOW the key characters on the sheet.
3. Look up the key character on the column header.
4. Find the encrypted character in that column.
5. Write the character in the row header above the key character.
6. The characters above the key characters are the decrypted message.

##otpadgen Command Reference
```
USAGE: otpadgen [-m] [-H | -h <header>] [-l <linelen>] [-w <wordlen>] [-k <keylen>] [-s <f|a>] -o <text|num> 
-h <header>   print this string as the first line of the output
-H            print a generated header string as the first line of the output
-k <keylen>   key length in chars
              default: 400
-l <linelen>  line length in chars, used by text output mode
              note that each char needs 2 spaces + word gaps
              default: 25
-m            character matrix output, no pad is generated-o text       output as simple text
   num        output as numbers
-s <f|a>      character set to use
              f = full character set: alpha, digit, punctuation
              a = abbreviated character set: alpha, digit 
              default: f
-w <wordlen>  word length in chars, affects printing only
              default: 5

Generate a one time pad that can be used for encrypted message exchanges.
By default a printable format is produced in ASCII text that includes the
following characters for the full set:
_!"#$%&'()*+,-./0123456789:;<=>?@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
and the following characters for the abbreviated set:
_0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
<space> rendered as underscore (the underscore character is not supported)

You will need the character matrix (Vigenere square) to encrypt/decrypt.

Steps to encrypt:
1. Coordinate which sheet you will be using with the receiving party.
2. Write your clear text above the characters on the sheet.
3. For each character:
   a. Look up the clear text character on the column header in the matrix.
   b. Look up the key character on the row header in the matrix
   c. The enrypted character is at the interesction of the column/row
      write that below the key character on your sheet.
4. The characters under the key text are your encrypted message, send this
   to the receiving party.
5. Rejoice at the strength of your cryptography!

Steps to decrypt:
1. Coordinate which sheet you will use with the sender.
2. Write the encrypted message BELOW the key characters on the sheet.
3. Look up the key character on the column header.
4. Find the encrypted character in that column.
5. Write the character in the row header above the key character.
6. The characters above the key characters are the decrypted message.

#Random number generation

Weak random number generation will result in weak cryptography.  If a mal-actor
can predict your random number generator output then they may be able to divine
the key you are using for one time pad cryptography.  It is very important that
you use a reliable source of entropy to generate your pads.

Whole books have been writton on generating true random numbers so I am not going
to try to cover the topic to any level of detail here but rather will offer a few
thoughts on the most important potential issues.  There are two primary vectors
for compromise:

* Mal-actors that introduce means with which to reliably predict the output of the RNG
* Mal-actors that leverage side-channel attacks that influence the output of the RNG

We will ignore the third (and arguably most common) vector which is an operator using
an RNG not capable of producing entropy.

In order to be able to trust the random number generator (RNG) there must be no
"black boxes" in the hardware OR you must truly be willing to trust the folks that
built the RNG with the data you are encrypting (as if it were handed to them in the
clear).  Most modern computers fail to meet this criteria.
s they leverage a pseudo RNG - often a very good one, but still a PRNG.  They also
are FULL of opportunities for a mal-actor to introduce back doors or other means for
creating predicatable output from the RNG.

Better sources of entropy are simple hardware devices for which the hardware
and software design is fully transparent.

#TODO
* port to freebsd, linux
* use autoconf/automake
* allow for alternative sources of entropy (files, hardware, etc)
* man pages
